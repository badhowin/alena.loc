This project is about colour itself. I wanted colour to be pure and absolute but I could sacrifice this a little bit so that the end result won’t be just a colour stain. Though colour stains are beautiful, I think there are a lot of works like stains. And I think this is more for artists, but I’m a photographer.

I work as a psychologist for several years, but I’ve never used such a thing as chromotherapy. And I’m not sure it really works as written, but still I’m sure, colours could cause some emotions and I think, it’s interesting to aware the influence of colours.

Here are some still lifes and compostions for your journey into colour. If some colour feels uncomfortable you may choose another one. Enjoy.
