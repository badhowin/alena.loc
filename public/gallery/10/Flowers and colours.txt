In this short photo series I decided to study complementary colours and I was really impressed with it. That’s why I decided to share it with someone else.

The idea of a photo series came to me from the very phrase “color and flowers”, because in my mother-tongue these words have the same root (цвета и цветы).

The photos were taken in a rented flat in Tallinn, using one artificial light source and natural lighting. Flowers which I used were: irises, tulips, anthurium, ranunculus, gerbera and anemone. I tried to pick flowers and backgrounds in such a way that the processing of photos was minimal.
